summary(imdb)
# There are 7334 missing endYear, 7 missing runtimeMinutes in the databset. 
# How we should dael with them?
# Since the endYear column have more than half of the values are missing, then this column does not have any substantial meaning to the dataset, I suggest that we drop this column. We can also drop the 7 missing runtimeMinutes since it does not have a huge impact on the entire dataset.
